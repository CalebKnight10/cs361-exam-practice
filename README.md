# CS 361 Exam Practice

A repository for practicing the workflow necessary for the final exam.

You should:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Look at the code and identify problems
4. Create 'issues' for each problem you see
5. Then, for each problem, you should:
    1. Create and check out a feature branch `git checkout -b featureBranchName`
    2. Make the necessary changes and commit (hint: `git status` is your friend. bonus: mention the issue with `References #N`)
    3. Switch to the master branch `git checkout master`
    4. Merge the commits from your feature branch into master: `git merge featureBranchName`
    5. Push
    6. Close the issue
6. Visually review your commits on the master branch within the GitHub UI
7. Submit the https URL of your repo on GitHub in Canvas
